unfork(2)
=========

Introduction
------------

### Q: What the hell is this?

**A:** The inverse of fork(2).

### Q: That doesn't explain a lot.

**A:** Not really a question, but sure. fork(2) splits one process (really, address space) into two. unfork(2) joins two address spaces into one.

### Q: And doesn't sound very useful.

**A:** More of a comment again. Think of this technique as taking a cheap snapshot of another application that you can read, write, execute, discard, repeat, all while leaving no <sub>p</sub>*trace* and sending no *signal*. Heh.

### Q: How would that even work?

**A:** The magic of Linux! By combining [`userfaultfd`][] with [`process_vm_readv`][], any userspace application can obtain a copy-on-write mapping (with some limitations) of memory it never owned. All it needs is ptrace privileges, which is to say, having the same uid usually works.

[`userfaultfd`]: http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html
[`process_vm_readv`]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_vm_readv.2.html

### Q: Still, what do you actually need it for?

**A:** Dynamic binary analysis and instrumentation of applications with built-in integrity checks. As far as I know `process_vm_readv` isn't even detectable if the agent process is more privileged than the examinee processâ€”so you're free to manipulate your private copy of the application in the comfort of your own address space.

### Q: How limited is this approach?

**A:** It's true that meshing address spaces is much harder than copying them. Especially on 32-bit systems, the likelihood of a collision is high, and that's why everything is built using [musl][], which excels at producing compact, straightforward binaries that fit into the areas the kernel doesn't place anything into; 64-bit systems with ASLR are far more forgiving. Nevertheless, I think that with some effort two allocators or even dynamic linkers could survive together.

In terms of functionality, you get virtual memory and [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage "Thread-Local Storage, not that socket thing") (TLS is everywhere!) but not, say, files or shared memory; at some point a kernel module would be necessary. On the platform support side, x86_64 and i386 seem to work well, and those two are also the most challenging ones.

### Q: Very interesting, thank you.

**A:** You're welcome!

Getting started
---------------

Keep in mind that this repository is nothing more than a proof of concept.

You'll need [patched](musl-no-vdso.patch) musl-gcc. (Using stock musl mostly works by accident on x86_64, but will usually crash on i386 without the patch.) After that, check the paths in the `*.specs` files, run `make` and it's done.

The demo code uses `puts` as an entry point and prints two messages; the first one using a clean snapshot of another process, and the second one reusing the same snapshot. Any process that dynamically loads `libc.so` works, e.g. `/bin/cat`. Run `./unfork[32|64].elf $(pidof cat)` and enjoy.

Although `puts` may seem trivial, it involves a surprisingly deep call stack (well... in glibc), syscalls, TLS, vDSOs, and is probably more complicated than the kind of problems I originally set out to solve.
